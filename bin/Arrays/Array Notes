Arrays:

Advantages:
			1) Random Access to elements
			2) Cache Friendliness

Disadvantages:
			1) Wastage of Space
		ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>(); 
		Here also some predefined memory of space is allocated firstly,
		And as soon as that memory is filled extra space is allocated automatically.
		
		
Time Complexity:

3 operations are there 1) Insertion 2) Deletion 3) Search

1) In the end
	Insertion and Deletion have O(1) time complexity

2) In the middle
	Insertion and Deletion have O(n) time complexity
	
	
	
	
	
Time Complexity of Insertion in ArrayList/Vector

Suppose we are having O(1) time complexity for insertion till the predefined memory is filled
then O(n) for copying the previous elements to the next array of bigger size...... So the average
Time Complexity is O(1) only.

(O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) ..... + O(n))/ n+1 = O(1)
