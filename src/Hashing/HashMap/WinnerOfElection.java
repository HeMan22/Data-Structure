/*
Example 1:

Input:
n = 13
Votes[] = {john,johnny,jackie,johnny,john 
jackie,jamie,jamie,john,johnny,jamie,
johnny,john}
Output: john 4
Explanation: john has 4 votes casted for 
him, but so does johny. john is 
lexicographically smaller, so we print 
john and the votes he received.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
Votes[] = {andy,blake,clark}
Output: andy 1
Explanation: All the candidates get 1 
votes each. We print andy as it is 
lexicographically smaller.
